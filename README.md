# Welcome!
I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign advised by Prof. Julia Hockenmaier. My research primarily centers around model architecture engineering, including: 
- Creating and analyzing novel deep learning model architectures
- Analyzing and enhancing training strategies in the Mixture-of-Experts framework
- Leveraging prompt engineering for model compression
- Improving language model compression techniques
